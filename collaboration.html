    <p style = "align:center">In Spring 2017 our team was awarded a Michigan Humanities Collaboratory Proposal Development Grant for our project “Argentine Afrikaners: Interrogating Hybridity in a Unique Diasporic Community”. In this project, we are examining the practices of a settlement in Patagonia, Argentina, which presents an exceptional situation of cultural and linguistic contact between Afrikaans (spoken in South Africa) and Argentinian Spanish (spoken in South America). From our perspective, the socio‑historical circumstances that led to the existence of this group are extremely rare and the linguistic case they present is unique.  <br><br>

For our Collaboratory project, we are working with a corpus of oral narratives from approximately 20 Afrikaans-Spanish bilingual speakers, as well as from 15 other family and community members (who only speak Spanish). This corpus of oral narratives was collected in 2014 by Andries Coetzee, Lorenzo Garcia-Amaya, and by Nicholas Henriksen, and they provide candid insight into our community’s social and cultural practices, and their linguistic ideologies, while offering a wealth of unique linguistic data. Our project aims to study these oral narratives both for their linguistic structures and in terms of their ideological content, working to correlate their unique forms of linguistic and cultural conservativism.<br><br>

We see the Collaboratory as a way of affording us the opportunity to test how linguistic and cultural research traditions can both inform and challenge each other. Though linguistics research does take into account the socio-cultural identity of speakers, it seldom does so at the same level of sophistication as research in cultural studies. Similarly, cultural scholars do work with language as an integral part of cultural identity, but seldom at the same level of detail as linguists do. We expect that a deeper, more intense collaboration between linguists and cultural scholars can lead to new insights and methodological innovations in both areas of study.<br><br>
