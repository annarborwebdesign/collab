          Joshua Shapero is a recent PhD in Linguistic Anthropology at the University of Michigan. His work draws on mixed methods, combining ethnographic, grammatical, and experimental research among Ancash Quechua speakers in the central Peruvian Andes to study mechanisms of interconnection among language, environmental practice, and cognition. In this project he is working with Professor Szpiech to understand discourses of race, language, history, and religion among South African Argentinians.
